# House_price_prediction
House price prediction model using Linear Regression based on different features like Area, Bedrooms ,Age  and how they are correlated.
## Key findings
-Area has a strong positive correlation with price — as area increases, price tends to increase.
-Bedrooms also has a positive correlation, but weaker than area. 
-Age has a moderate negative correlation — older houses tend to have
lower prices.
-Area is the most influential feature for predicting price
-Price distribution shows right skewness with some high-price outliers
-Residual plot shows no major pattern — good linear fit
